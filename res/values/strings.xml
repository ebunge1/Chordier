    <string name="home_info">Welcome to Chordier! \n
        This app is designed to help musicians and song writers with
        the sometimes difficult task of creating chord progressions.
        Chordier currently provides two services: a chord progression
        builder, and a melody builder. These can work for all major
        and minor keys and all diatonic chords.
    </string>

    <string name="chord_info">Chord Progression Builder \n
        Here you can create your own chord progression. Click the plus
        button to add a new chord and start writing. If you get stuck
        or would like some assistance, click the bottom of the screen
        to filter the best chords specific to your own progression.

    <string name="melody_info">Melody Builder \n
        Here you can generate chord progressions to support your melodies.
        Use the grid to punch in your melody. Each column counts for one
        sixteenth note. To help, beats are counted for you below. Empty
        columns are treated as rests and sustained notes can be represented
        by selecting strings of the same note.
